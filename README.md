#MESSAGE FROM MLNGN
MLNGN React Concepts interview/exercise
This is a barebones React application which serves as a template to explore your understanding of some common React concepts.

Instructions
Our goal is to allow you to demonstrate your web development skills while working around all of our schedule limitations. We hope that you only spend about one hour completing this exercise. After completion, we will spend 30-45 minutes in our final interview session, where we will discuss your approach to this exercise and complete one basic live coding question.

Create a JSON or Javascript object which defines an inventory of at least four products, each having the following details:
Name
Price
Image
Create the following React components:
Product Inventory
Displays an Inventory Item component for each product in the inventory

Inventory Item
Displays the Name, Price, and Image of a single product

Shopping Cart
Displays the names of any products which have been added to the Shopping Cart
Populate its contents from your choice of state/store (can be simple for this exercise, but be prepared to talk about your choice!)
Render the Product Inventory, all product Inventory Items, and Shopping Cart from the application landing page (App.jsx)
Add a button to the Inventory Item which adds a product to the Shopping Cart when clicked.
That's it! The main goal of this exercise is to see how you structure UI components and share data between them in response to user actions.

Notes
This is meant to be a quick exercise about basic React concepts. Because of that, it can be ugly. Styles are not important, and all components can appear visually on the landing page at the same time.
You can find the code's console.log output in the browser console (i.e. Chrome Inspect), not in the integrated repl.it console.
This sandbox does not support TypeScript (but we wish it did!)
Even though this is meant to be a small one-off exercise, please take the opportunity to demonstrate strong code organization and separation of concerns.
If desired, additional dependencies can be added to this project like any other by updating the package.json file.
We are hoping to understand your effective use of React built-in APIs and/or related libraries. Demonstrating clean implementation using existing tools is more important than writing boilerplate code from scratch.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
